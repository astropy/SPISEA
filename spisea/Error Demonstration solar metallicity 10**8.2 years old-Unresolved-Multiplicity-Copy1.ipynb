    "## Testing the BPASS isochrone at 10^8.2 years age. (Unresolved Multiplicity)\n",
    "In this BPASS isochrone and cluster plot, I go over the BPASS isochrone for 1 billion years age, solar metallicity, AKs=0.5, and distance of 2000 parsecs from Earth. From the isochrone and cluster, we discuss several plots such as the log_g frequency distribution of the isochrone, the color magnitude diagram (B-V vs pseudo-M_V), and the mass luminosity relationshi of the cluster. **Note that I say pseudo-M_V as it is the absoulte magnitude but NOT accounting for extinction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for pseudo M_V\n",
    "pseudo-M_V = V - $log_{10}$(distance to cluster/(10 pc))\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen dist to cluster = 2000 pc to further distinguish this notebook from the other 10^8.2 year old isochrone Notebook.\n",
    "**As the title indicates, I have decided to use unresolved multiplicity in my BPASS and MISTv.1 clusters.**"
