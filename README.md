# Ryota Inagaki's fork of SPISEA

SPISEA is an python package that generates single-age, single-metallicity
populations (i.e. star clusters). It gives the user control over many parameters:

* Cluster characteristics (age, metallicity, mass, distance)
* Total extinction, differential extinction, and extinction law
* Stellar evolution and atmosphere models
* Stellar multiplicity and Initial Mass Function
* Initial-Final Mass Relation
* Photometric filters

Here is a brief list of things that SPISEA can do:

* make a cluster isochrone in many filters using different stellar models
* make a star cluster at any age with an unusual IMF and unresolved multiplicity
* make a spectrum of a star cluster in integrated light

See [documentation](https://spisea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
details on installing and running SPISEA. We also provide jupyter notebooks with a 
[quick-start tutorial](https://github.com/astropy/SPISEA/blob/main/docs/Quick_Start_Make_Cluster.ipynb)
and [additional examples](https://github.com/astropy/SPISEA/tree/main/docs/paper_examples)
demonstrating how to use SPISEA.

If you use SPISEA in your research, please cite [Hosek et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200606691H/abstract).

## Version Update
Version 1 of this software package was called PyPopStar. Due to a naming conflict,
we have renamed the package of SPISEA for version 2 and beyond.
For reference, v2.0.0 has the same functionality as v1.0.1.

Instructions for updating from version 1 to version 2 are provided in
the documentation [here](https://spisea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/version_switch.html#version).

## Contributions
We encourage contributions to SPISEA, particularly those that add
support for star formation histories, new models, higher spectral
resolution, etc. For feature additions, we ask that users make their
own fork of the repository, make their changes, and then submit a pull
request to the "dev" branch.

All contributions will be acknowledged on the
[contributors page](https://spisea.readthedocs.io/en/dev/contributors.html#contributors). Contributors
with features used in code releases will be co-authors in future SPISEA software papers.
