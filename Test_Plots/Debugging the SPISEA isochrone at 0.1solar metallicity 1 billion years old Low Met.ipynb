    "## Testing and Debugging the BPASS isochrone at 10^9 years age.\n",
    "In this BPASS isochrone and cluster plot, I go over the BPASS isochrone for 1 billion years age, 0.1solar metallicity, AKs=0.0, and distance of 1000 parsecs from Earth. From the isochrone and cluster, we discuss several plots such as the log_g frequency distribution of the isochrone, the color magnitude diagram (B-V vs M_V), and the current-mass luminosity relationship of the cluster."
