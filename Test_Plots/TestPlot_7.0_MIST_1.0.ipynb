    "## Testing the BPASS Isochrone at $10^{7.0}$ Years Age and Comparing with MIST Model (Solar Metallicity)\n",
    "In this BPASS isochrone and cluster plot, I go over the BPASS isochrone for 10^7 years age, solar metallicity, AKs=0.0, and distance of 1000 parsecs from Earth. From the isochrone and cluster, we discuss several plots such as the log_g frequency distribution of the isochrone, the color magnitude diagram ($B-V$ vs $M_V$), and the mass luminosity relationship of the cluster."
